    Multivariate normality test
 	
 	The function assess the multivariate normality of a dataset by means of
    Royston's test, Henze-Zirkler test, or Mardia's combined tests. Royston's
    test should be used by deafult, but such a test can be performend only up
    to 2000 observations. Therefore, Henze-Zirkler test should be used on
    larger datasets; however, this test yields meaningless results on datasets
    containing more than 50 variables (the variance of the lognormal
    distribution used to determine the p-value tends to 0, causing the
    propagation of numerical errors). Mardia's combined test (on both
    multivariate skewness and multivariate kurtosis) should be therefore used
    for datasets with more than 50 variables and more than 2000 observations.
    The R library  MVN is used, therefore a link to the R language by means of
    the rpy2 package is required.
    
    Parameters
    __________
        X : array_like, 2d
            Dataset to be assessed, must have shape (N, V)\n
        test : {'hz', 'royston', 'mardia_comb', 'mardia_skew', 'mardia_comb'}
            Multivariate normality test to be performed
            
            * 'hz' : Henze-Zirkler test (default)
            * 'royston' : Royston's test
            * 'mardia_comb' : Mardia's combined test (data are deemed as normal
            only if they are by both Mardia's skwness and kurtosis test)
            * 'mardia_skew' : Mardia's skewness test
            * 'mardia_kurt' : Mardia's kurtosis test
            
        alpha : float
            Significance level for normality test
        ddof : int
            Degrees of freedom of the variance for Royston's test and
            Mardia's tests, can be either 0 for normalizing the
                    variance by N (default), or 1 for normalizing by N - 1
        scale: bool
            Logical flag to scale columns of the dataset to unit variance
    
    Returns
    _______
        norm : bool
            True is dataset is multivariate normal
        p_value : float
            p-value of the chosen test, if test = 'mardia_comb' a tuple with
            p-values of Mardia's skwness and kurtosis is returned
        stat : float
            Value of the statistic of the chosen test, if test = 'mardia_comb'
            a tuple with statistics of Mardia's skwness and kurtosis is
            returned
